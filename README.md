# ðŸŒ´ My Personal Website - https://dhruv-puvar-512.github.io/Dhruv-Puvar/


This is my personal website - for now it's a simple landing page with my intro and projects. <br>
I plan to make v2 with a full fledged website, fully functional with a blog and other cool stuff!

### âœ¨ To-Do Doodle Do

- [ ] Make more projects and add em
- [ ] Work on integrating a blog
- [ ] Think about a complete redesign
- [ ] A github contribution history kinda thing
- [ ] Adding a timeline would be cool
- [ ] A game being played by AI/ML (dino, pacman or snake)
